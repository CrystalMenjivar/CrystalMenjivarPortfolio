            In this project we got to work in partners to make an infographic about anything we wanted to choose In our Graphic Design class Fall of 2014. We chose the topic of phones. We chose this topic because phones are a very popular product that many people have and people can relate to. We made the timeline of the history of phones, the countries with the most phone usage, Generations of smartphones usage, and the most common reasoning for buying a certain service company. I illustrated the phones that are in the timeline with the information, and the Reasoning for buying a certain service company. We then presented this in front our class. </p>
        <p> We were giving about two weeks to work on this project. Gathering all the information and making all the graphics. This project was cool for me because I got to learn about the history and how they changed so much over the years. This project went under use of resources because we used resources such as the internet and Illustrator. We had to go online to gather information and then we went into Adobe Illustrator to make the graphics and the final product.
