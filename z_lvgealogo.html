        <p> This project was done in Winter of 2016. For this project we were asked to make a 60th year annivery logo for the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance. They came to us with what they had in mind for the logo such as the color sheme, the font, the symbolism, and more. After they had taked to us we made 10 rough sketches of some logos, then we chose our two favorite and drew it in detail. Then we went into illustrator or photoshop to make it. This is one of the logos I made. We then presented it to them and to the class. They only asked to see the logos they liked, so only about 10 people presented their logos to them. Fortunately I was one of those students that was chosen to present to them. I was actually suprised that they chose me, I wasn't expecting that they would choose mine. They are now in the process of choosing which logo they like the most for LVGEA. 
        </p>
         <p> This project was a memorable one because we got to present to a real client that could use a logo that we designed. If my logo gets chosen that would be amazing, but some of the other students logos were really good. I would say this project would go under work ethic because the bottom line was how good and visual appealing our logo was. How much work and effort we put into the logo. I enjoyed this project because we got to design a logo ourselves and see where our skills are designing something like this for a real client in a big company.
