            In this project We had to choose a font that we liked and had to give a 5 minute prezi presentation on it in my Graphic Design class Winter of 2014. I chose the font Waltograph because it is the font disney uses and I love disney. We had to talk about the history, the creator, if it had serifs, san serifs, and more. Then we had to write the word in creative way. I chose to make it with toothpicks. The  font had lots of curves so I had to be careful of what I used because of that. </p>
        <p> This project was difficult because we had to talk about a single font for 5 min which was hard at first but after we had all our information about it, we realized that it filled up the time needed. I did end up learning a lot about that font and other fonts that my classmates presented. This Project went under work ethic because I did get lots of information that I spent lots of time getting and putting them into the presentation. I also had to present the final product which was a prezi to the class.
