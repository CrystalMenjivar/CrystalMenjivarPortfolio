        <p> This project was done in my Freshmen Studies class Spring of 2014. We were to research a person, dead or alive, that made a history in the world in a positive way. This project was to teach us how to use MLA formating, so we had to cite all of our sources and make a citation page and intext citations. I chose Walt Disney because I love Disney. I wanted to choose somebody that I was intrested in so I can not just do it for a grade but to really learn about him and his background. 
        </p> This project was a bit stressful because we had a certain amount of time that we had to finish and it didn't seem like it was enough time. We had to reasearch all the information and put it on this human shaped paper. We had about 6 papers to put different topics. Also when we were done we had to present it infornt of our classmates. This project went under work ethic because we had to have quality information into it and make quality citation pages.
