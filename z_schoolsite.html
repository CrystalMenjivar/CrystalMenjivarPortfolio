        <p> This project was done in Winter of 2016. For this project our main focus was to make a website responsive. Which basically means that it is viewable and usable in smaller screen such as tablets and phones. We were to also recreate our current school site swcta.net. We were to make a new school site and make it responsive. We were in teams of 4-5, my team had 5 members. One person was the designer and did the mock up which is done in photoshop or illustrator. Another person was doing the HTML which is the first step in coding the site without any desgins or "decoration." Then we had another person doing the CSS which is what makes the site "pretty." Then we had a person taking care of the SEO and the content that would be in the site. I took the job of SEO and content because we had two stronger coders in the group. This picture is the home page of our site. We then presented our site to some administration from our school and the class.

        <p> This project was cool because our current school site isn't that visual appealing and orginaized. We got the chance to potentialy make a more appealing and a site with more school spirit. This project could cover every tenet but overall I think it would go under presentation skills because we were grading on how our site looked, was orginized, and how we presented it. This project did get a bit stressful at times because we had some trouble with the code. Like some of the things we planned for the site didn't end up happening because we couldn't get it to work. Overall our site was a success and I am proud of our group.
