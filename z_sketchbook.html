        <p> For this project We were to come up with a theme and make an art work out of it. This was done in Fall of 2015 in my Graphic Design III class. We had actually started working on the project the privouse school year in spring of 2015. Unfortunatly the process to make it took much longer than we thought and had to postpone the project. Luckley we were taking a graphic design class again with them same teacher so we countinued it the following school year. The process was pretty long: first we had to come up with a theme, mine was music, then we had to research that theme, then we did research on different kinds of painting and artist, then we made a sketches of ideas, and then we moved onto our final product. I made this painting in the program called Sketchbook Pro. 
        </p> I enjoyed making this project because everything we did was up to us. This project was personal and different than anything else we had done. This project would go under work ethic because you can see how much work we put into these works. Like I put in time and effort into this project. Also everything including the colors and textures have symbolism. During the develpment of this painting I wasn't painting a certain person I was just painting a random girl to represent a person listening to music. Then I realized that the girl kind of looks like me so it kind of became me in the painting.
