           <p> This project was done in my english class fall of 2015. For this project we had to read a book that we chose from the school library and read it outside of school on our time. We had about 5 weeks to read the book and the book had to be at least 200 pages and not be made into a movie. I chose this book "Clay" by David Almond because it looked very differnet from other books and mysterious. It had a weird element to it which made it intresting to me. In this project we had to make a graphic orginizer with the plot elements on the book such as exposition, rising action, climax etc. We also had to write the theme and a quick jist of the book with out spoiling anything. We were to make it digitally so our teacher could post it and if we were to go looking for a book we can look at a graphic orginiser such as this to know what the book is about than just the small description on the back of the book. </p>
        <p> I actually made this in Illustrator. I felt like it was more accessible to me and had more freedom than other programs. I thought this project was a good idea. I liked that students made these graphic orginizers so we had a btter idea if we wanted to get the book or not. I would say that this project went under Writing Skills because we had to use ou tplot elements, identify the theme, and give a jist of the story without giving out any major points. This project was a bit frustrating for me because i'm not big on reading so it ws tough to make my self read the book on my own. I also wasn't sure how to give a jist about the book without spoiling anything.
