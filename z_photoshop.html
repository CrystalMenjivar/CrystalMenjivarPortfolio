        <p> I got my Visual Communication using Adobe Photoshop CS6-Mac Certification in Winter of 2014. These are exams that are through a program called Certiport. I actaully studied pretty hard for this. I don't think i've ever tried so hard to get a certificate. I really wanted this and even though I don't see myself as being a graphic designer in my future I still wanted to get it. It took me about 3 tries to pass the exam. We started studying by doing practice exams on a site called GMetrix. Once we passed those tests we were able to start taking the real exams. The exam was difficult and challenging but once I passed I was so happy. I needed atleast a 700 to pass and I passed with an 805. This went under content knowledge because it was an exam showing what you know and your skills about Photoshop.
