            This was a project we had to do in my english class freshman year. Spring of 2014. We had been studing Greek Mythology and the Greek Gods. We had to randomly pick a greek god in a group of 4. We got the greek god Perseus. We had to write about his heroic journey that he took. We also had to write his steps of the hero's journey that we studied. Then we presented it in front of the class. </p>
        <p> This project was put under content knowledge because my team members and I had to know all the information that we learned from his journey and how he was heroic. We also had to really know our are information when we were presenting because we couldn't have a note card or something to read off. This was actually our last project in that class  for the year. This was the biggest and most dificult unit of the year and this project was a great way to finish the unit and year.
