        <p> This Project was Called the Hour of Code and was done Winter 2015. For this Project the Web Design sophomores, juniors, and seniors with some admin and teachers went to Mark L. Fine E.S. to do the Hour of Code and teach them the basics of coding. We started planning this project in early November with the stages of planning what positions and roles are needed to make this whole thing possible. We had two managers that made sure everything was on track and many other things. There was a marketing team that made the graphics such as this logo and much more. There was also a curriculum team which was what we were actually what we were doing when we got there and the curriculum that we were teaching the students. Then we had the Website team. The website team made a website of the hour of code and the project. I was in the curriculum team. Curriculum was seperated into the different grade levels and I got the kindergardners.

        <p> When the day came in December we walked to the Mark Fine and taught them the basics of coding with original games and activites we made. Overall this Project was successful and a really awesome experience. I really enjoyed playing coding games with the kindergardners. This project could go under every tenet but I think over all it would go under Presentation Skills. Overall what mattered at the end of the day is how we presented ourselves to the students, how we presented Southwest, the Web program, our explainations of things, and how we presented coding. This project did get supper stressful at points such as making the scrips. It was difficult to find the write words to explain things to the kindergardners because they are so young. Overall I really enjoyed this project and would do it again.
