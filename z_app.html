        <p> This project was done in my Business Software Application class also known as my computers class spring of 2014. We had to come up with a new creative app. It was hard to come up with an app that didn't already exsist or was to similar to our idea. Of cource we didn't actually make the app because we don't know how to. We chose to make an App that could make an outfit for you and let you know a store's inventory. You would take pictures of all the clothes that you have and then the app would put outfits together that would macth. When you first go into the app you would see the screen that you would choose your gender. Then it would get into the picture taking of your cloths and such. 
        </p> 
        <p> This PBL was a long process. We first had to do like an elevator speech of our idea in our group to the class. Then we got comments and suggestions from our classmates. Then we moved into a deeper explaination of our app to the class. Then we had to come up with a kick starter to get the app starting to the class. Then we presented our final presentation of the app. This project could have gone into every tenet but I would say team work and collaboration because we were put into groups of about 5 with people we didn't know. We all had to come with an idea and compromise with the decisions and the final product. This PBL was a bit stressful because it had to be creative and we had to think about the little things. We also didn't have a flexible schedule because we were at the end of the school year and we had presentation the last day before exams. Overall I think the final presentation was strong and ended up the way we wanted it to.
