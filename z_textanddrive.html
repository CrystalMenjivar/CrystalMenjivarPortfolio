            For this PBL we had to make a campaign on teen awareness in my Freshmen Studies class in Spring of 2014. We chose to do texting and driving because it has become a big issue especially in this generation. We also made posters that we hung in the hallways of our school and bookmarks that you get after you take the pelage to not text and drive. I was very proud of the outcome to this PBL. We did a lot better than I expected we were going to do. This was time consuming to make but the grade we got was well worth it. </p>
        <p> For our presentation we did a gallery walk in the ballroom at school with other grades and classes to come up to us. We did very well in the presentation and overall it turned out great. This project was put under work ethic because we spents lots of time on this project and work really hard on it. I also learned a lot of life lessons doing this project. I learned a lot of how much texting and driving can impact you and just how looking down for 3 seconds can get you killed in a car crash.
