            In this PBL we had a Hip Hop dance group come to our school to teach us, Web design students, a simple short Hip Hop routine. This took place Winter of 2014. We had a PBL day at school so each program area did a different activity for two school days. On the second day we taught them a little bit of what we do in our program area classes which is Web design. We were in different groups that were assigned to us and in those groups we had to teach the Hip Hop group the basics of the program Illustrator.
        <p> This was personally my favorite PBL that I have done. We danced the routine they taught us on the first day in front of our classmates and my team actually got first place. We also preformed the dance in the cafeteria during luch as a flashmob the last day before winter break just for fun. This PBl went under Presentation skills because day one we were presenting to them the dance they taught us and they were presenting to us. The second day we presented to them about Illustrator and helped them through the process of making simple shapes and graphics.
