            This work is a combination of two projects I did in my Graphic Design class. The dog painting in the background was a group project. We were put in groups of 4 and each person had to paint a corner of the dog picture. I painted the bottom right corner. The icons were a part of our fall PBL. We had to make a 3D slotted sculpture using no glue or tape. We decided to make a future computer. This graphic was the screen of the computer. This was only one part of the final product.</p>
         <p>This was completed Spring of 2014. This project was very difficult to do but taught us a lot. I learned things such as time managment, team work and collaberation, and patience. This project was put under presentation skills because at the end we had to turn it in and we didn't necessarily present it but the product its self was the presentation. This poject was stressful but worth it at the end.
