            This is a painting of a fish statue that I made in my Graphic Design class Fall of 2014. I used the program SketchBook Pro to paint it. We were to take a picture of anything we wanted and then paint it with 3 different color schemes how ever we wanted. I chose to do analogous colors which is 3 to 4 colors next to each other on the color wheel. I feel that my strongest part of this painting is the bottom of the fish and its shadow. I spent the most time on that part of the painting and am really happy on the outcome of it. 
       </p> This painting wasn't very hard per se, but it was time consuming. The better I wanted the painting to be the longer and more thorough I had to paint it. This project went under use of resources because we had to use the resource of SketchBook Pro. I really enjoyed doing this project. I always love doing art and testing my art skills. I love watching how my art grows to be better than before.
