        <p> This PBL was done spring 2015 in my Web Development 1 class. We had to make a Webite using HTML and CSS to show who Dante Alighieri was, he's works that he has done, his levels from Dante's Inferno, and the time period. We had an actual client which was one of the sophomore english teachers. He has his classes read Dante's Inferno and do a project on it. I was in his class so I had some previouse knowledge on the subject. We were put into groups of 4 to do this project. The picture above is actually the mock up of the home page of the website. A mock up is basically what you want the site's pages to look like using Illustrator or photoshop, before going into the codeing part to know what you are making it look like. 
        <p> This PBL was actually pretty difficult for my group. None of us were code savvy and able to code that well. We were all decent in coding and could do the basics but we just had a hard time with that part. It was also pretty stressful because we had a supper short time crunch so we definelty learned some time management skills. Most of the time spent working on the project was outside of school because we didn't have much time to work on it. I would say this PBL would go under work ethic because it shows how much time and effort we put into the website and the coding.
