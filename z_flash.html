        <p> I got my Rich Media Communication using Adobe Flash CS6-Mac Certification in fall of 2015 in my Graphic Desgin III class. These are exams that are through a program called Certiport. I actaully studied pretty hard for this. I don't think i've ever tried so hard to get a certificate. I really wanted this and even though I don't see myself as being a graphic designer in my future I still wanted to get it. It took me about 2 tries to pass the exam. We started studying by doing practice exams on a site called GMetrix. Once we passed those tests we were able to start taking the real exams. The exam was difficult and challenging but once I passed I was so happy. This went under content knowledge because it was an exam showing what you know and your skills about Flash.
