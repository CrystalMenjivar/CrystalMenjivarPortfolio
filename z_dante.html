            For this project my 3 other team members and I had to make our school ,SWCTA, into a "hell." This project was done in Winter of 2014. We had just finished reading "Dante's Inferno" and we had to create our own levels of hell using our school. The presentation had to  be abstract and we were not allowed to use a poster board or a powerpoint of some kind, like those typical school project presentations. We work thoroughly on this project and creatively. After we made our project we had to present them to the class. This took us about 2 week to make.
        </p>
        <p> This is one of those projects that I feel like I worked my hardest on. We spent many hours working on this making the levels, stairs, the clay figures, and the descriptions. Hours during school and more after school. I'm very happy with the outcome of this project and proud of my teamates and I. This project went under work ethic because we did spend lots and lots of time working on this project and making it thorough.
